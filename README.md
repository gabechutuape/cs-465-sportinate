# Sportinate
Final Project for CS 465

This project was a collaboration between myself, Andrew Fei, Monica Para, Fei Ma, Xinkai Yuan, and Sruthi Jayanti, for CS 465 User Interface Design.
The point of this project was to learn about conducting user research for the sake of producing an application that addresses a realistic problem that can be solved specifically by software that we can develop.

* The Problem
When brainstorming for a problem, we found that we knew many people who had trouble finding recreational or competitive groups to play sports with on campus.

To find how to address this problem, we interviewed three people of representative categories for different demographics of people who faced the issue. 

Namely, we interviewed a competitive player, a casual player, and someone who wanted to try playing sports with others for "the first time".

Across the board, we suggested ideas for how an app could solve their problems and what they would want to see in an app that addressed the problem in a way that did not specifically influence their ability to convey what they wanted solved: an important point in this software development process was understanding WHAT the problem was. In order to accomplish this, maintaining a level of distance from influencing the opinions of our subjects was critical.

The problems that people faced were that current solutions for finding sports groups were either bloated by inactivity (Facebook Groups), poorly maintained (Reddit threads), or intimidating to access (in-person meeting).

* Our Solution
Our solution was to make an app that allowed people to create, find, and sort groups based on what sports they were interested in playing, as well as a host of other criteria such as time availability, skill level, commmitment interest, and the like.

The result was our Java app Sportinate, which we made entirely in Android Studio over the course of eight weeks. It features a groups tab for browsing currently ready to join local sports groups, group coordination options for hosting your own sports groups, group joining, and profile creation.

Although the functionality is not up to public use, the app stands as a testament to the importance of conducting good user research for the sake of solving people's problems. We learned of the paramount importance that comes with understanding what the problem you're trying to solve is before egregiously developing software that either solves the wrong problem, attempts but fails to solve the right problem, or a mixture of both.
